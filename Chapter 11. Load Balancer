********************* Load Balancer *********************

- provide redundancy (SPOF - single point of failure)
	- extra copy to handle failure
	
>> 3 DC Cluster
1) HPC - High performance cluster (Rock solid - ccluster software)
	- in aws called as "Placement Group"
	- we design this because of short of CPU and RAM

2) HA - High Availablity Cluster
	- fail over cluster 
	- havily used in Banking
	- VCS / Redhat cluster
	- in aws HA givem by AZ
	- STONIH (shoot the other node in head)
	- Split brain senario

3) LB - Load Balancer Cluster
	- all nodes in active state
	- F5 cluster
	- Baracuda Cluster
	- In AWS ELB
	

>>>> ELB Types
1) CLB - classic 
	- round robin - Health Check
	- works on aws instance
2) ALB - application 
	- only work on http / https 
	- routing policy(RR / path based / keyword based)
	- support instance / containers / IP  
3) NLB - network 
	- work on any port numbers
	- high throughput lb
	- Volatile traffic
	- transport layer
4) GLB - gateway 
	- third party virtual appliance load balancer 
	- e.g.: F5 or Baracoda LB

**** DNS load balancer vs VPC load balancer

>> OS Model
1) Appication
