********************* DNS *********************

How to identify computer on network :
Name > map to ip address > map to MAC ID

1) Recognise computer by : Hostname

2) IP Address

>> Local address of a service : port number : 
well known prt number : /etc/services
c://windows/system32/drivers/etc/services

ARP : address resolution protocall

>> Switch - MAC-ID

Last level communication on MAC ID

#nslookup
- to find name and ip

#arp
- to find mac id

Two ways to resolve name in ip

1) Local DNS (peer DNS)
- not scalable
- error 
- used for small networks

com1
- /etc/hosts
	- 192.168.0.10	com1.radical.com

com2
- /etc/hosts
	- 192.168.0.11	com2.radical.com

2) Global DNS

>> Simple DNS
- work with caching

www.google.com -> Resolver -> /etc/hosts(Admin) if not then -> /etc/resolve.conf (Admin and DHCP server)

DNS server also called as name server

1) nameserver : your company DNS server ip
2) nameserver : isp DNS server ip
3) nameserver : 8.8.8.8
4) nameserver : 4.4.4.4

3 and 4 google dns server and used for chaching

53 - named - caching file and ip return to system


#traceroute
#tracepath

** Router discovery protocall

DNS TTL 1 day

/etc/nsswitch.conf  (to chnage order edit in this file)

#mtrr


>> Complex DNS

- perform recurrsion

www.google.com.  >> this last . known as . root server having static ip
13 root server 
root hint file

.root DNS server
- having TLD (top level domain)
	- .com	ip
	- .org	ip
	- .gov	ip
- maintain by ISOC and IANA

.com DNS server
- google.com	ip
- yahoo.com		ip
- gmail.com		ip


SOA - start of authority

DNS uses UDP protocall - fast

for SOA > multiple slave server calld NS record

recursive query and iterative query
