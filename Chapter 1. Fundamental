** Fundamental **

>> Virtualization
- Optimum utilization of hardware resources
- split H/W

>> Hyperviser
- Hypervizer is a software it will take strong h/w and for sharing purposes it is going to split the h/w into something which is called VM

>> Contenerization
- Spliting OS
- Light weight virtualization
- share only application

> CRE - Container Runtime Engine
 - To help to create container

> How container works (features of linux kernal)
1) namespace (what you are allow to see)
2) c-group (quota) (How much you are allow to use)
3) union file system

> lxc (linux container)

>> Container Advantages : 
- Light weight
- security (SE linux) security enhance linux
- 3 VM = 9 Container
- more application packing dencity
- cost effective
- fast
- less mentainance
- less paching

**in container either linux or windows

**container poisoning

**container size in MB's

ECS - Elastic container service (Docker)
- Highly secure, reliable, and scalable way to run containers

***** Single point of failure (SPOF) *****

- Multiple system
- container orchestration engine tool - kuberneties and In AWS called EKS (Elastic Kuberneties service)
- to manage container

** Docker Swarm

- CI/CD

** Hardware Appliance - h/w preconfig os and app

** Virtual appliance - share VM - in cloud 90% Virual appliance
