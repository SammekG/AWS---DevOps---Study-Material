********* EC2 - elastic compute cloud - Regional Service ***********

**EC2 is a web service which allow us to create virtual and bare metal servers

>> Bare metal because i do not want to use xen or KVM hypervizer i want to use my own hypervizer

instance/ server/ VM/ compute  -- they all can be intrerchangibly used

just like a server, or a Virtual machine or like my own computer

What is a virtual machine?

EC2 - benifits :

1) Easy - because web server
2) V.V.Fast
3) Flexible / Elastic / Scalable
4) Resizable
5) Web Service
6) Secure
7) Reliable - SLA
8) Pay as you go

>>>> Architecture of EC2 <<<<

- Server Layer / H/W Layer
- Hyperviser Layer
- EC2 Layer

https://aws.com > ec2 service > Region > AZ > Schedular > take decision where to create instance (hypervizor) > Create Instance

**EC2 is a web service to create virtual machine

**EC2 is Resional and it's zonal (AZ based) service

**All instance disk came from SAN storage and it's called as EBS

**SAN storage data easily move from 1 instance to another

**Instance store is a Temporory storage

>>>> Tenancy Model <<<<

1) Shared Tenancy
- Most popular
- Cost effective
- Like PG / shared auto ricksha

2) Dedicated Instance
- Like Single room

3) Dedicated Host
- ESXI - Paper Licence - Dongal
- Like Own Flat

Based on Tenancy instances are classified into two types
------------------------
1. Shared tenancy model - it is the default option
2. Dedicated tenancy model -- it is extremly costly, 
not very good option in prod servers


>>>> Purchase Option - Types of Ec2 instance <<<<

1) On Demand Instance.
- Most Expensive
- per sec - per min pricing
- Testing

2) Reserved Instance
- 1 Year to 3 Years
- Production

3) Schedule Instance

4) Spot Instance
- Bidding

Types of Ec2 instance based on the reservation model
-----------------------

1. on-demand instance -- will be the costliest, 
almost 60% costlier than the RI
2. reserved instance (RI) -- you will reserve instance for a 
specified period of time -- 1 year or 3 years

				there are three payement models of RI
				
					1. all upfront -- the cheapest option  -- 1000
					2. partial upfront -- half downpayemnt + other half in eqauted monthly insta (EMI) 
															-- 500 + 600/12 = 1050
					3. no upfront -- costliest -- 1100

3. spot instance -- AWS will let the unused compute to offer at a very discounted rate
					You have the option to request Spot Instances and specify the 
					maximum price you are 
					willing to pay per instance hour. 
					If you bid higher than the current Spot Price, 
					your Spot Instance is launched and will be charged at the current Spot Price. 
					Spot Prices often are significantly lower than On-Demand prices, s
					o using Spot Instances for flexible, 
					interruption-tolerant 
					applications can lower your instance costs by up to 90%.



>>>> SIZE - Instance Type <<<<

t - tiny 1 CPU 512 RAM
M - mediam
G - general purpose
C - CPU (compute) optimize
R - Memory Optimize
D - Disk optimize
X - x larger 4096 CPU - 4 TB RAM

****Once you rebbot EC2 instance then it only Operating System Services Refresh

-------------------
Types of Ec2 instance based on the compute nature
-----------------------
1. general purpose  -- 
2. compute optimized -- will have high end CPU/processor configuration compared to 
rest other parameter
3. memory optimized -- will have high memory ratio. 
- want to perform cache operation
4. storage optimized -- will have high storage capabilities compared to other parameters
5. GPU enabled -- speciaqlized with Graphics card, 
gamesing, video encoding, deep learning, NEURAL DESIGN

ONPREM DS - 

IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service -- EC2 - 
PAAS - Platform as a Service - AWS Bean Stack
SASS - Software as a Service

in RI two types of offerings
------------------
1. standard
2. convertible

3 years t2.micro 3000 INR all upfront
		1 year 1000 deduct == 2000 

t2.xlarge -- 1500 per year

In Free Trail account - t2-micro
-------------
750 hours of t2.micro in a month

1 * 24 * 31 days = 744 ~~ 750

2 * 24 * 15 days = 720

3 * 3 * 30 days = 270

4 * 24 * 8 days


Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
---------
RDP - rempte desktop protocol -- a windows server from a windows computer -- port 3389
SSH -- secured shell connection- a linux server from my Windows computer  -- port 22 
HTTP -  80
HTTPS - 443
---Putty---

airport
passport

SSH Key pair
----------
-- Pubic Key (AWS will store it and will also be injected in the instance) 
++ Private key ( you have to store it). They are mathematically related. KARAN - ARJUN

At every login on instance, you will provide Private key, which AWS will match with the Public key. If they both recognises each other, 
then you will be allowed to login. 

A key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores, 
and a private key file that you store. 
Together, they allow you to connect to your instance securely.

You have to download the private key file (*.pem file) before you can continue. 
Store it in a secure and accessible location. 
You will not be able to download the file again after it's created.

Public IP -- which can be used on Internet  -- it is unique across globle -- mobile num
Private IP -- can only be used within a network  -- office desk extn number -- 
can be duplicate i.e. in one network a Pvt IP can be there, 
same pvt IP can be there in another private network -- TCS

Putty-- will help you to connect a Linux Instance from a Windows computer

In order to work with Putty, you would not be able to use the .PEM file.

***Symetric Key
- session key
- short key > common key - priv - public
- not permonent (it's available till session active)

How communication happening in SSH?
1) Sync
2) ssh:22 > random number - encrypt
3) decrypt (random num) - private key

--------------------- Elastic IP ---------------------

An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time.

An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region.

##### Rules of Elastic IP

1. elastic IP is very very costly
2. if you have allocated an EIP, and you have not attached it to any instance, 
then we are going to charge you heavily
3. if you have allocated an EIP, 
and you have attached it to a instance, and the instance in in STOPPED 
state then we are going to charge you heavily
4. if you have allocated an EIP, and you have attached it to an instance, 
and the instance is in RUNNING state, then we are not going to charge you

Volume/ EBS ( elastic block storage)

1. Root Volume -- mandatory ( just like the C:// drive becuase it contains all OS related files/folders)  
-- name must always be "/dev/xvda"
2. Additional volume -- optional

Types of EBS volume
--------------------

1. SSD ( solid state drive) -- they are costly than HDD
		1. general purpose  (gp2 / gp3)
		2. Provisoned IOPS (io1/io2/io3)
2. HDD ( hard disk drives)
		1. sequential throughput optimized (st1) -- 
		big data, data warehousing, log processing
		2. sequential cold (sc1) / cold HDD 
		( archival purposes, infrequntly accessed data)
Magnetic -- previous gen volume		

Throughput -- measures the number of bits read/write per second 
-- measure the amount of data transferred in a sec
IOPS -- measures the number of read/write operations per second 
-- number of operations performed in a sec

100 Bricks --

1 round - 10 Bricks - Throughput
10 round - 100 Bricks

Q- can I choose all types of EBS volumes as my ROOT volume?
Ans- HDD types are not avaialble. SSD and Magnetic are avaialble.

Q- can I choose all types of EBS volumes as my Additional volume?
Ans- Yes, all HDD, SSD & magentic

Free tier eligible customers can get up to **30 GB** of EBS 
**General Purpose (SSD)** or **Magnetic storage**.

** Size and Type both can be modified.
** The size of a volume can only be increased, not decreased.

Q- can this volume be detached from this machine? to attach it to another instance?
Ans- yes

Q- can an EBS volume be attached to multiple ec2 instances at the same time?
Ans- NO
15.206.92.13
43.205.115.78

Q- can i detach the ROOT volume?
Ans- No. You cant detach ROOT volume from a RUNNING instance. 
Additional volumes can be attached/detached when the instance is RUNNING. 
If the ROOT volume is not attached to an instance, then it cant be STARTED.

Q- will the billing of STOPPED instance be ZERO?
Ans- It will not be ZERO, but it will be almost nulls, very less amount of bill.

EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. However, you can choose to automatically delete an EBS volume when the associated instance is terminated.

If it is ON, then that volume will be terminated when the instance will be terminated.

If it is OFF, then that volume will be remain in your account when the instance will be terminated.

EBS volumes which do not have "Delete on Termination" set to true will persist after this instance is terminated.

Q- can i move my EBS volume from one AZ to another AZ?
Ans- yes can be done but not at the hardware level. Data level movement is possible. 
Create a SNAPSHOT, restore that SNAPSHOT into volume and there select the AZ

lsblk ===list block devices
df -h === file system

In Linux instances, when you will create and attach a VOLUME, two tasks to be performed--
1. create a mountpoint
2. create a file system

mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf -- created fs

mkdir /myadditionalvalume

mount /dev/xvdf /myadditionalvalume

xfs_growfs /dev/xvdf

umount -l /additionalvolume
